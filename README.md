# DexDictate for macOS

A high-performance, privacy-focused dictation bridge for macOS. DexDictate runs locally, converting speech to text with zero latency and full privacy, designed to seamlessly integrate with your workflow.

## Key Features

- **Total Privacy:** All processing happens on-device. No audio ever leaves your machine.
- **Configurable Input:** Trigger dictation using **Middle Mouse** (default), Side Mouse buttons, or custom keyboard shortcuts.
- **Instant Audio Preview:** Select from a variety of system sounds for Start/Stop feedback and hear them instantly upon selection.
- **Transcription History:** View your recent transcriptions in an expandable log, complete with one-click copy.
- **Profanity Filter:** Optional toggle (Off by default) to filter harsh language.
- **Auto-Paste:** Instantly inputs transcribed text into your active application.
- **Quick Settings:** Easily toggle settings, restore defaults, and link to this repository directly from the app.

## Installation

### Option A: Download Release
Download the latest pre-built application from the [Releases](https://github.com/WestKitty/DexDictate_MacOS/releases) page.

> **Note:** If you encounter an "Unidentified Developer" warning, simply Right-Click the app and select **Open** to bypass the check.

### Option B: Build from Source
To build the application yourself, ensure you have Xcode installed, then run:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will compile the app and install it to your `~/Applications` folder.
